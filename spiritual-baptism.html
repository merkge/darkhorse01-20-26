        <h2>Dream: A Spiritual Baptism</h2>

        <div class="dream-block">
            I do not remember the first part of this dream. However, at some point, I
            am immediately rocketed high into the air. I am aware of something
            accompanying me below waist level and I somehow know that it is my dog,
            Keesha &mdash;a beautiful Keeshound and Chow half-breed, with a wonderfully
            laid-back disposition. We flew over a breathtaking gothic medieval
            city of concentric castles, around a central shimmering, silver
            cathedral. I fly down into the cathedral and I am headed directly
            towards an altar within one of the private vestry rooms. Just before
            landing, I drop my thick eyeglasses and they crack. The top of the
            altar then opens and I splash down hard into a bath of water. I am then
            standing in the room dripping as a critical little man enters, walks
            right up to me, disapprovingly shaking his head and finger, while
            chattering something I can not hear, presumably something like; "What
            are you doing here, you don't belong in here!"

        <div class="interpretation">
            <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
            <p>Out of my possible confusion, I am suddenly being <em>rocketed into
            a new dimension</em>! The significance of the dog in this dream was that 
            several months prior, I was facing a crisis that may have required that I let go of
            the dog. I had wanted a dog all of my adult life, but I was never in a
            position where I could responsibly have one. By midlife, I finally
            could no longer wait and adopted her from a shelter. I then had to move
            several times just to keep her. As my life situation worsened, it
            looked as if I would finally have to find another home for her.</p>

            <p>I loved her a great deal; I took her most everywhere with me, rather than
            leaving her at home alone. However, in a lot of pain, I finally hit my
            knees and told God that I was willing to let go of her if necessary. My
            being willing to give her up was a very big deal, because I had
            encountered so much loss in my life, that the sense of having to let go
            of even my beloved dog was beyond overwhelming. Amazingly however,
            through this dream, God was letting me know that He would take care of
            both me and my dog.</p>

            <p>The brilliant city of concentric circular castles, suggested to me 
            St. Teresa of Avila's classic work, <em>The Interior Castle</em>,
            whereby seven concentric layers of less deadly creatures are traversed
            by the seeker of God, on the way from the outer wall to the spiritual
            center. This is also an extreme form of Jungian mandala or wholeness symbolism. 
            The dropping and cracking of my eyeglasses indicated that I
            needed to begin to walk by faith and not by sight. My complete
            immersion in water upon an altar in a secret, sacred room suggests that
            I am being fully initiated into the spiritual life. And this is
            occurring despite any thoughts or feelings of unworthiness on the part
            of my inner shadow figure &mdas; the critical little man &mdash; or even possibly
            any collective shadow personification of my society as a whole.</p>
