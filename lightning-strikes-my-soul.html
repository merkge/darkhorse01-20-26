    <h2>LIGHTNING STRIKES MY SOUL</h2>

    <p>Two days before Thanksgiving 2011, I&nbsp;had the most intense exit of pain from my body that I&nbsp;have yet experienced.</p>

    <p>I told a healing group the latest sequence of an excruciating ongoing conflict with a female supervisor. I&nbsp;described how I&nbsp;finally had had enough of a great deal of inappropriate behavior, and how I&nbsp;retaliated by embarrassing her to tears in front of others even though I&nbsp;did not mention her by name.</p>

    <p>When I&nbsp;finished sharing with the group, I&nbsp;thought for a moment and said, <b style="color: #800020;">"I think I&nbsp;just need to ask for God's forgiveness."</b></p>

    <p>I was then instantly struck by "emotional" lightning.</p>

    

    <p>My body jerked back and elongated in my chair as booming primal screams ripped out of my soul. When all the air was expelled from me, I&nbsp;was released forward like a rubber band just long enough to suck a large breath of air, before being ejected backward screaming into contraction again.</p>

    <p>The commotion was so great that six or more of those present within the group had to leave the scene, leaving only four able to witness the violent howling contortions of my body. One of them was a female singer-songwriter we had never before met, who happened to be passing through town for the day. She encouraged me to stay with it and to ride it all the way down. She kept telling me how amazing I&nbsp;was.</p>

    <p>My self-consciousness and low self-esteem would have almost certainly caused me to terminate this healing process early, had it not been for her help. However, I&nbsp;was able to stay with the energy as it eventually ground all the way down to a slow cackle and finally silence.</p>

    <p>Disorientation swam in my head for up to five minutes after the contractions ceased. Several of those present said that it seemed that there was something collective going on, but that was nowhere in my conscious experience. I&nbsp;was aware that what had occurred was as intense as any demonic possession that I&nbsp;had ever heard of. My whole body remained sore for five or six days.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px;">
        As far as healing experiences go, <br>
        <span style="color: #800020; font-size: 1.2em;">THIS WAS THE BIG ONE THAT I&nbsp;HAD BEEN WAITING FOR. <br>
        IT WAS FAR GREATER THAN I&nbsp;EVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED!</span>
