         <h2>The Overshadowing of The Christ</h2>

         <p>In September and October of 2007, I began to experience especially intense feelings of utter meaninglessness as to my reason for having been born into this world at all. I had experienced these existential crises before, but this seemed to be the worst. My entire life felt like a wasteland. There seemed to have been no reason for my coming here, except to experience my absolute otherness in relation to everyone and everything that I encountered. I did not feel that I was made for this world.</p>

         <p>In an uncanny and peculiar way, I felt especially drawn to the statements made about Jesus Christ in Isaiah 53:3. For when evaluating the whole of my life experience, I definitely felt "despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." However, I was also powerfully resonating with The Gospel According to John's statements, (10:30) "I and my Father are one," and "I do nothing of myself alone, the Father he doeth the works." One night, at a recovery group that I avoided and did not feel emotionally safe at, I shared my sense of being completely estranged from society and the world. I was then so emotionally distraught and embarrassed that I had to immediately leave and go to my car, where I encountered one of the most intense spontaneous bouts of grief that I had yet experienced. As I shared these feelings in recovery groups, I sensed a subtle yet powerful overshadowing of my own personality within, but I did not exactly know what was happening. I tried to tell myself that whatever it was, it was only occurring on the 'psychological' level, since I realized that it was considered blasphemy to not only fundamentalist, but even mainstream orthodox Christianity. The one thing that I did know, was that the Christianity that was coming home to me, from the inside out, was a very different Christianity, than that in which I had been raised. I later confirmed in <i>The Power of Myth</i>, that Joseph Campbell claimed that transcendence is achieved through a mythical or mystical identification with the deity, as seen in Hinduism. Furthermore, Alan Watts in his masterful <i>Behold The Spirit</i>, warned of the danger of losing the spiritual effectiveness of Christianity, because of the progressive loss of the spirit of mysticism within the faith.</p> 

         <p>I even went so far as to dare to work with this energy by dressing up as Jesus at a recovery Halloween party. On the front of my costume, I wrote "Despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief," and on the back, in an orange, red and black background of chaotic fire, "<b>Follow Me or Go to Hell!</b>"</p>
