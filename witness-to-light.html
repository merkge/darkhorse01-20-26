        <h2>A Witness to my Inner Light</h2>
        <p>One Sunday, in the final stillness rhythm of my spiritual dance class, I was sitting and maintaining eye contact with a  woman partner present for the first time.  I noticed something like smoke mildly blocking my view for a moment or two, and thought that it was probably just my perspiration.  However, in the circle sharing at the end of the class, my partner told the group that she saw a strange light over my head.  I was shocked.  I shouted "I knew it!" and everyone laughed.  I then turned to a young woman friend sitting beside me and I said "Did you hear that?" She replied very smugly: "Oh, everybody has that!"
