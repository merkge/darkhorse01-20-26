        <h2>Dream: The Gila Monster</h2>
        <p>The following dream occurred on 1-2-2000, a short time after my discovery of Sufism:</p>
        <div class="dream-block">
            Over a several hour period, I see my white-socked foot repeatedly playing with a mysterious 
            black swirling object that seemed to be attacking it. I feel curiosity, adventure and danger. 
            Eventually, a very wise male voice called me by name and said, "You're playing with a Gila monster! 
            Do you really want to do that?"
        </div>
        <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
        <div class="interpretation">
            <p>The foot represents my spiritual path or possibly my attempt at walking my own spiritual path. 
            The Gila monster is a particularly scary and dangerous form of the symbol of the <strong>serpent</strong>. 
            The very word "monster" itself indicates danger, and indeed, the Gila monster is a <em>venomous</em> lizard.</p>

            <p>It is also constantly blurred and swirling, indicating that it is vague, mysterious and elusive. 
            In Sufism, the serpent represents the sum total of all that which is deepest and darkest within the 
            unconscious self. The sock itself may be seen as a form of protection, particularly since white is 
            associated with purity or redemption.</p>

            <p>The swirling of this vague black object about my foot also feels reminiscent of the dangerous 
            deathmatch between a matador and bull. There is also the obvious contrast between opposites, 
            emphasized by the black monster attacking my white socked foot.</p>

            <p>Clearly, I am being told that Sufism is a path that has inherent ties to Jungian depth psychology, 
            or the psychology of the unconscious. Jung repeatedly claimed that the process of individuation 
            required one's ability to withstand the tension of the opposites within oneself.</p>
