    <h2>Buddha's Best Friend: An Experience of Quasi-Enlightenment</h2> 

    <p>In 2001, I had a short color dream clip of a modern businessman approaching my dog, Keesha outside a business. He held a ten or twenty-dollar bill in front of her, to which she responded with a dull, blank stare.</p>
 
    <p>For a week or two, I attempted to interpret this dream. I tried the theme of 'can't serve two masters,' and so on, but nothing clicked. Then one morning in meditation, I realized the dream's possible connection to a famous Zen buddhist riddle, or koan, that I had chanced upon in my spiritual search, namely, <b>"Does a dog have a Buddha nature?"</b> Now, a koan is a metaphysical puzzle given from master to student in the Rinzai Zen tradition, as a spiritual exercise intended to assist the goal of enlightenment. In general, a koan has no rational or logical answer, but only an answer from beyond the student's rational or dualistic mind. Said differently, the only correct answer comes from the non-dual realm of unity lying beneath the realm of opposites that comprise the world as normally perceived by human beings. The purpose of a koan is to drive the student crazy in attempting a solution through human reason, until finally, after the dualistic mind is completely exhausted, the student's non-dual or 'original mind' rebounds by delivering the obvious solution in an intuitive flash of mental enlightenment (from the collective unconscious). This is an instantaneous inner experience of certainty &mdash; involving the student's whole being &mdash; and a powerful conscious response, as if to say, "Well YES of course! ... That's it! ... How could it be otherwise?"</p>
 
    <p>So, after recognizing that my dream seemed to fit this famous Eastern mind puzzle, I began to consciously ask: "What is the Buddha nature" or "What did the Buddha do?" After some thought, I recalled that the Buddha and his followers went from house to house with a begging bowl. In other words, since they were completely concentrated on spiritual matters, money meant virtually nothing to them. <b>In a flash, I then realized that, as my dream suggested, money also means nothing to a dog.</b> Therefore the answer to: "Does a dog have a Buddha nature?" ... must be "YES! A&nbsp;DOG CERTAINLY HAS A BUDDHA NATURE!"</p>

    <p>I was flabbergasted at the intuitive answer from within that came with the speed of a cracking whip, as well as my recognition that <b>my own collective unconscious had actually tossed my conscious mind an ancient spiritual puzzle in dream form</b>, several weeks prior. I was further amazed since this was the only Zen koan that I had ever consciously seen prior to the time of the dream.</p>
  
    <p>I finally recalled that the word 'Buddha' actually means 'the Awakened One.' I&nbsp;gasped and became very serious and quiet, as I secretly wondered: "OH MY GOD! ... IS THIS IT? ... AM I ENLIGHTENED?"</p>

    <p>I then fell to the carpet in hysterical laughter.</p>
