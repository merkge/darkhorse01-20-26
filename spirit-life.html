      <h2>Choosing the Spiritual Life</h2> 

<p>     Any true spiritual path is better than no spiritual path.  Only the spiritual life can solve the problems that are inherent in life itself.  This is because all human beings---rich, poor, young, old--- suffer from 'the human condition.'   Indeed, the first of the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha is that 'all life is suffering.'  The overriding characteristic of our suffering human condition is to perceive oneself as separate and apart from God, nature, and those around us.  The result of this belief in separateness is some degree of desperate grasping, due to self-centered fear.  In the language of Christianity, the Apostle Paul referred to this human condition as the natural man, who "receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned (I Cor 2:14).  If I am alone then I am on my own.  It is then up to me to struggle and fight to get what I need and want to survive in this world.  It is Me against Them.  I must constantly be on guard or they will take from me what I have worked so hard for.  I can include others in my life, but only as long as they are on My side and see things My way.  Then it will be Us against Them.  Either way, there must always be people, places,  or institutions that I must Fight---that is---as long as I (choose to) remain in the human condition. </p>


<p>     But as soon as we consciously begin the spiritual life, whether we know it or not, we have brought in the spiritual condition.  The spiritual condition is not based in fear, but rather, in love.  It works in our lives, because it is aligned with our deepest nature, which is love.  Many of us are not yet conscious of the spiritual fact that what we truly are is love.  Love is what we are.   </p>
