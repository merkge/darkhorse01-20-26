<h2>The Tao of Einstein: A Basic Spiritual Interpretation of the Theory of Relativity</h2)
<p></p>

<h3>If There Exists an Absolute Reality, Then <u>Time is an Illusion.</u></h3>
	
<p> I began studying physics in undergraduate school in the late
seventies, and I have long been fascinated by the most famous
scientific theory of all time --- Einstein's theory of relativity. It
essentially says that the speed of light is the only thing in the
universe that never changes. This means that, if someone stands on the
earth and shoots a flashlight beam in any direction away from the
earth's surface, while another person chases after the beam with a
speed of 99 percent the speed of light, then the second person cannot
gain on the beam at all. In fact, the second person will measure the
beam as moving away <i>from himself</i> at the full speed of light,
despite the fact that he is moving faster than the flashlight by 99
percent of the light beam's speed! </p>

<p> Since speed is the distance traveled in space, divided by the time
taken, one of the consequences of this incredible finding, is that,
from the vantage point of the stationery individual, the 'space' of the
second person must contract or 'bunch up,' while his 'time' must dilate
or 'stretch out,' both being required by the much verified fact that
the same light beam moves past both observers at the same speed of
light. (However, the moving individual knows nothing of any shift of
his or her space and time, the space and time in his or her frame of
reference remains perfectly normal. It is only from the stationery
observer's point of view that the moving observer's space and time are
shifted). This means that all distance and time measurements made by
the moving observer must yield shorter values than the same
measurements made by the stationery observer. This must be, so that
mathematically, <i>the quotient, distance divided by time, yields the
same value, namely, the scientifically verified, constant value of the
speed of light</i>.  This means that <b>contrary to our everyday
experience, neither space nor time are absolute in the physical world
that we know within our human perception. Rather both space and time
are completely relative and variable with respect to this world; they
both vary with the speed of the observer making the space and time
measurements.</b> A meter stick is correctly measured to be less than a
meter, when the person doing the measuring is moving past the stick at
speeds comparable to the speed of light. Likewise, an event measured by
a stationery observer at the location of some event, to have a five
second duration, will be measured to occur in a shorter period of time
by an observer moving past the event at high speed. This relativity of
time and space is always present, even at very low speeds. However, in
our daily life, we do not see this variation because it is not
noticeable to our maximum capacity of measurement, (the shift is
smaller than our resolution capability) until the relative difference
in speeds becomes very large. </p>

<p>The important point for our current purpose is simply that <b>time is not absolute, but relative, with respect to our own 'humanly perceived' world.</b>  It can therefore be said that <b>time is not completely real in our physical world.</b>
If we then postulate an ultimate or Absolute Reality that our physical
world is relative to, or derived from, we obviously observe that, from
the perspective of this Absolute Reality, the physical world is less
real than Itself. Next, we pose the question: <b>Then what is the relationship of time to this Absolute Reality?</b>
The answer is that, since time is not even completely real, here,
within our perception of the physical world, then when we view time
from the level of absolute Reality, it follows that it must be even
less real. However, what is the meaning of 'less real than relative,'
or 'relative to relative?' After some thought, I was convinced that
anything 'less real than relative' must be nothing at all. In other
words, from the position of Absolute or True Reality, time is a
complete illusion! Another way to say it, is in the form of the
following proof:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Time is relative to the physical world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, the physical world is relative to the Absolute World.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, time is <i>relative</i> to (something <i>relative</i> to) 

the Absolute world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the definition of the term, 'relative' only has meaning in the 

sense of 'relative to some absolute.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This means that the double term 'relative...relative'  above, says 

that time has no meaning, or, has the meaning that time is nothing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time is therefore an illusion with respect to absolute Reality.<br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If there exists an Absolute Reality, then <u>time is an 

illusion</u>.</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; QED.   </p>
