    <p>On Friday, February 8th, 2008, during an afternoon walk in the park, began yet another powerful mystical experience and chapter of my life. As usual, I&nbsp;walked and performed a silent variation of the Islamic Sufi <i>dhikr</i>, or remembrance of God, whereby I&nbsp;mentally place upon my heart, the Arabic words: <i>La ilaha il'Allah</i>, (No! There is no god but God, or There is no reality except Absolute Reality, or No truth but Truth).</p>

    <p>However, I&nbsp;stopped in the frustration of yet again catching myself engrossed in negative, critical, angry thoughts about others that I&nbsp;found offensive. But, this time I&nbsp;had finally had enough, and I&nbsp;was determined to do something about it!</p>

    <p>After considering what I&nbsp;might do, I&nbsp;asked myself the question: <b>"Would it help, if while repeatedly affirming that God is all there is, I&nbsp;simultaneously remind myself, somewhere in the back of my head, that it must follow, that even 'I' do not exist?"</b></p> 

    <p>I immediately began to apply this as I&nbsp;continued walking. As I&nbsp;performed the dhikr, I&nbsp;pointed to the back of my head and simultaneously affirmed that I&nbsp;did not exist. Within a few moments, I&nbsp;was catapulted into an experience of sheer ecstasy that I&nbsp;can only characterize as the "flight of the one to the One." Within this state of absolute consciousness, there was no me, no ego, but only a single, or rather non-dual, all encompassing awareness, filled with a crystal clear, overwhelming intense stream of pure Bliss.</p>

    <p>For the next several days, I&nbsp;was in and out of another world. My response was both amazement and extreme gratitude. I&nbsp;now knew that 'Of myself alone, I&nbsp;am nothing;' that my ego, or everything that I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;am, is in Reality only an empty phantom. I&nbsp;clearly saw that the absolute Truth about me, the only Truth, is that, I&nbsp;am a reflection of God! All else concerning my thoughts, attitudes, personality and behavior, is illusory appearances that in actuality contain no real Substance (on the level of Spirit).</p>

    <p>For several weeks, I&nbsp;joked with others that "I do not exist." Of course, they simply thought that I&nbsp;was nuts! Only later was I&nbsp;struck by the strange fact that I&nbsp;had frequently repeated this dhikr for a number of years, and never realized its deeper, paradoxical meaning: </p> <div class="quote"><b>If there is only God, then Who am "I" ?</b></div>
