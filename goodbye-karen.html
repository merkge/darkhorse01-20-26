 Karen M. was a very special friend that I met at the Sunshine Al-Anon meeting in Houston in 1990.  She was one of the few people that cared enough to want to try and help me.  
      Karen's own story was horrendous.  Her mother abandoned her when she was two years old.  Her father was a merchant marine.  By the time she was 15, her and her sister had been 'farmed out' to over 45 different friends or relatives in both Texas and Louisiana.  At age 15, Karen married an abusive, bubba Texan that believed in keeping his woman barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen.   He was a workaholic that owned a tile company.  Her abandonment issues were so powerful that she divorced and re-married this man three times before finally leaving him and their two boys.  Her older son was indoctrinated by his father's worldview and never forgave his mother for leaving, while her younger boy simply never understood why she had to go.  
     By the time that I met Karen, she had gone to school and become an X-ray tech and had gone back for a year to become certified in MRI imaging.  In 1991, she was hired at the hospital where I went to graduate school.  I would go by regularly to visit with her in the clinic on second shift.   Karen and her roommate began studying "A Course in Miracles" together in 1991.  Despite everything that she had been through, she was a highly spiritual person with a huge heart.  However, due to unforseen circumstances, I became estranged from her in the Summer of 1992.
      One Monday in September 1992, while I was volunteering to assist in the teaching of labs for a short course offered through my department, I ran across one of Karen's co-workers.  She informed me that Karen died in a car accident the previous Saturday.  I was so shaken that I told my supervisor that I couldn't help with the lab.  Although we had not known each other for a long time, ours was a bond of the soul, welded by the depth of pain that we had both experienced in this world.  I was immediately cast into a state of deep grief at the loss of someone who had truly loved and accepted me, exactly as I was.  
       I soon ran across a long time, male friend of Karen's through the Sunshine Al-Anon group, who I had seen her eating with at a restaurant on the Friday night before .  He explained that she had met with him to say goodbye.  She had gotten into a dysfunctional relationship with a man that was heavily triggering her past abandonment trauma.  The pain was so great that she was praying for God to take her home.  (Incidentally, years later, her male friend denied to me that he ever said this and claimed that her relationship was going just fine.  This was solid evidence of a classic example of unconscious repression.  For whatever reason, he had to bury the truth inside himself).  

     The following day, just before she died, she was eating at the Olive Garden restaurant with her roommate, her roommate's daughter, and her roommate's boyfriend, Jim, who I knew through 12-step meetings and fellowship.   Jim told me that in the restaurant they were discussing 'what exactly is a spirit.'  Karen said that it certainly was not in the coffin with the body of a deceased person at a funeral.  After he returned alone to the table to leave a tip, the waitress said to him: "That woman has a certain aura about her."  Less than two minutes later, Karen's roommate's daughter ran a red light and the car was broadsided by a pickup truck.  Karen was Dead On Arrival at the emergency room with a peaceful smile on her face and not a scratch on her body.  The young girl driver received only a minor abrasion, but her mother, Karen's roommate was in the hospital for 4 months.
