    <h2>My Heart's Code</h2> 

    <p>Between 2000 and 2002, I&nbsp;began to sense a powerful mystical truth deep within my being. It came as a result of my trying to live a spiritual life and I&nbsp;just intuitively knew it was true. This strange inner knowledge or 'gnosis' both fascinated and baffled me. It most definitely was not of this world. I&nbsp;would sit in a recovery group and try to share it with others with the only words that felt adequate. I&nbsp;was often accused of being too deep, but I&nbsp;continued to share this sacred truth in the hope that it might benefit others in their spiritual journey. Indeed, in the years that followed, I&nbsp;would increasingly speak this language of the soul.</p>

    
 
    <p>I would share that I&nbsp;somehow knew that, <span class="quote">"God stamped a code on my heart before I&nbsp;was born."</span> In my earlier life, I&nbsp;was unaware of this code and I&nbsp;repeatedly violated it, with the result that I&nbsp;constantly hurt others. I&nbsp;eventually came to understand that I&nbsp;was simultaneously harming myself. I&nbsp;was unknowingly driving a wedge between myself and God and making it increasingly difficult to get back to Him. It made no difference that I&nbsp;did not know that this was happening. It happened just the same. At least from my human perspective, I&nbsp;was separating myself further and further from God.</p>  

    <p>The twelve-step process of healing has the end result of being <em>happy, joyous and free.</em> I&nbsp;have come to experience that this is a description of my natural state, the state of blessedness for which I&nbsp;was created. My soul was formed from a spiritual blueprint. However, my self-will had distorted my being, with the result being the feeling of dis-ease inherent to any disharmony. The twelve steps are therefore the spiritual principles, which when acted upon, restore me to my natural created condition of wholeness.</p>
