        <h2>Riding the Dark Horse of The Soul's Destiny</h2>
        
        <p>In 1993, I began to dabble in Eastern religions. This was a singularly
courageous thing for me to do, because despite my rather liberal
Episcopalian upbringing, and knowing next to nothing about the East, I
suspected that I might go crazy or that demons might possess me. My
former Christian beliefs, of which I might speak, but which I never
really&nbsp;knew how to put into practice,&nbsp;no longer
worked for me.&nbsp; I would tell people&nbsp; that I didn't
believe in God, but the truth was that I was inwardly terrified.
&nbsp;I was absolutely sure that I had gone too far, in hurting both myself and
others, in my insane addictive-codependent lifestyle, and that God was
definitely going to punish me for my sins. &nbsp;Combined with the
fact that, nothing inside me believed&nbsp;that I could in any way
change, this made it extremely difficult for me to believe that I could
be forgiven through Christ Jesus. &nbsp;In my self-judgement and condemnation, I felt that it was much too easy,
for me to have lived the way that I had lived, and then to simply believe that I
could hit my knees and ask for forgiveness. &nbsp; For many years
after beginning spiritual recovery, I would regularly
peruse the psychology and self-help sections of&nbsp;bookstores, seeking a proper understanding of anger, guilt, shame, loneliness and pain.
However, if
I saw a single bible verse quoted or even alluded to in a book, that
book&nbsp;went straight back on the shelf. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I discovered the writings of Alan
Watts, and was particularly affected by his first book, <i>The
Wisdom of Insecurity</i>. The reality of the bleak picture he
painted --- that nowhere in <em> this </em>
world is there any real security --- rocked the very foundation of my universe. I was absolutely terrified!  Yet, it proved to be a godsend in that, I somehow
saw and rose to the opportunity to go inside my own self, and attempt
to seek the Truth. This would prove to be one of few great
decisions that I had ever made. &nbsp;Being raised in a very sick
alcoholic family, I was completely out of touch with my feelings.
&nbsp;I had never had any compass with which to navigate
through life. Although I did not realize it, I did not even know how
to truly think for myself, I only knew how to react.&nbsp; However,
something had always bothered me about simply accepting the beliefs of
others with 'blind faith.' Somehow I sensed, that if I was going to
live and recover, then within myself I would have to completely clear
the field, of everything anyone had ever told me about God. And so I
began, what has become an incredible journey in knowledge and faith, to
discover the Truth, come what may. </p>
<p> Looking back years later, I could see that I am naturally the
sort of person, that sooner or later was destined to get to the bottom
of things. Because of the prevalence of Christian influence in my
American society, I also knew that, if I was to remain unbiased in my
search, that I would absolutely have to forego the wisdom of my Western
fathers. This left me with nothing to hang on to --- not even the hope
of a comfortable albeit false security --- and I was terrified! For the
foreseeable future, in a painful yet profound inner lonliness, I would
learn to ride the wild dark horse of my soul's destiny. &nbsp;Since
that time, I have intellectually and experientially gone to 'the four
corners of the earth' searching for the answers that I have needed just
to stay alive. &nbsp;In <i>The Power of Myth</i>, Joseph Campbell spoke of the few that have had to encounter <i><strong>original experience</strong></i>.
&nbsp;Many have accused me of being too deep, but the only reason that
I can claim to have witnessed any change or recovery in my life and
personality, is by my sticking to my own guns in following the
admonition: &nbsp;<i><strong>To Thyself Own Self Be True.</strong></i>  </p>
