         <h2>Therapeutic Synchronicity: When the Student is Ready ...</h2>

         <p>The psycho-spiritual phenomenon of <i>synchronicity</i> has been described by the world 
                famous psychoanalyst Carl Jung. He characterized it as an acausal coincidence between 
                 some material happening and some related psychological event, that occur within some 
                 degree of time proximity. The following is an account of the first major 
                 synchronicity that I recall having ever experienced:</p>

         <p>I met with my new sponsor for the first time after a 12-step meeting on 4-13-2009. After
                 I rambled for an extended period of time, he told me that he had to go, but that he 
                 felt that I could benefit from trauma resolution therapy. I knew that he was a 
                 couples and marriage counselor, but I had assumed that that was all. I very 
                 innocently asked: "Do you know of anyone that does trauma resolution therapy on
                 a sliding scale?" He replied that he would see me once a week at a low cost. 
                 I was shocked. He told me to call him and set an appointment and then left.</p>

         <p>I immediately began to experience grief because I realized that I had told myself that 
                 I didn't want to get close to this man because he sat on a board of therapists that 
                 I thought might one day have to review me in some way. I therefore wanted to stay as 
                 far away as possible, else he might see how crazy I was. But I saw that the real 
                 reason that I had not asked for his help in sponsoring me, was actually because I 
                 simply did not feel worthy of working with someone that could potentially help me. As 
                 I went about my business in the afternoon, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to 
                 call and set a therapy appointment or not. I felt like I was taking advantage of this
                 man, by asking him to be a sponsor and then his offering to do therapy at a low cost. 
                 I also thought that I had tried therapy years earlier and found it wanting, and that 
                 I didn't need another painful failure.</p>

         <p>I returned home and found he had called and left a message on the answering machine. It was obvious
                 he didn't know who he was 
                 calling, and was responding to an unrecognizable phone number left on his 
                 'caller ID.' My house mate later confirmed there had been no one home 
                 at my house to call him that day. So, the Higher Power had basically dropped my home phone 
                 number into his fancy answering system. Since I have free will, God had no way 
                 of knowing whether I would decide to begin therapy or not. And so,I was 
                 given this synchronistic message to let me know that I did not want to miss this
                 opportunity! God knew this guy was an awesome Gestalt therapist and
                 that serious healing was in store for me. I can no longer help but believe
                 that when someone truly wants to heal, the universe will conspire with them 
                 to provide exactly what they need, and that:
