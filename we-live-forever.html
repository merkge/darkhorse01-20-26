    <h2>"We Are All Going to Live Forever!"</h2> 
    <p>In a May 1995 spiritual retreat, I experienced a lucid mental period of about an hour or less. While in this non-ordinary state of consciousness, I shared my momentary intuitive awareness of certainty that:</p> <div class="quote"> "We are all going to live forever." </div> 
        <p>It came 'out of the blue' and I just knew it was the truth, and that was that. This is the first spiritual experience that I had which informed me of the reality of any life after death, or even of any kind of truly metaphysical information whatsoever. </p>
    <p>As my spiritual quest progressed, various information that I encountered in my personal studies did not seem to fit (theo-) logically with this revelation. While I didn't mean to seem that I was keeping score, I would be somewhat uneasy for a number of years by the idea of how to reconcile a universal need for divine justice that would give human life any coherent meaning, with everyone achieving eternal life regardless of their moral behavior. </p>
    <p>One day much later I laughed while recognizing that this first experience of gnosis, or directly revealed divine knowledge did not include a detail that I had unknowingly and automatically assumed. Specifically, while it was somehow revealed to me that we will all live forever, it was not revealed that we would all be enjoying ourselves. </p>
