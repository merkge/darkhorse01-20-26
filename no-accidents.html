    <h2>There Are No Accidents</h2> 

    <p>The woman that created the therapeutic dance space that proved so critical to my early healing was in fact not a licensed therapist. Like myself, her only vocational credential was that of having been ordained in ministry by a church that ordained anyone that felt themselves to have been spiritually called.</p>

    <p>She founded and ran an alternative therapy center with licensed therapists for a number of years. Therapists from all over the metropolitan area send their clients to her dance classes. I&nbsp;later learned in fact that we had been ordained by the same church. As I&nbsp;learned more about her, I&nbsp;was completely amazed by the story of how this remarkable woman had come to be in my life to offer me such healing.</p>

    <p>As a young girl in Peru, her father was an absent alcoholic. She was watched by her grandparents while her mother worked long hours to support the family at three or more jobs. She claimed that her grandfather would patiently and kindly listen to her incessant toddler babbling and how this later inspired her to want to listen to the problems of others.</p>

    

    <p>While still a very young girl, her father died tragically. But in the lining of his dirty, tattered jacket, her mother found the winning ticket of the national lottery. And so, she and her two sisters left the dire poverty of Peru to begin a new life in America. What I&nbsp;received from this woman's work was so precious, that it was very hard for me to believe that her coming into my life and providing this healing space was simply random coincidence.</p>
