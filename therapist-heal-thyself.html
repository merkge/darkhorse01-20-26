<h2>Therapist Heal Thyself: Intuitive Recognition of an Unhealed Healer</h2>
  
<p>     For twenty-four years, I have attended a 12-step program for individuals recovering from the harmful effects of growing up in alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family environments.  Of primary importance, these meetings have a high need for emotional safety, since people that were taught in childhood not to talk, trust or feel, must feel safe enough to break these old family rules, in order to begin the healing process.  In addition, ACA's usually have a tendency to try to fix and care-take others, rather than focus on their own self-care, and almost all ACA's exhibit as a core issue, the need to be in control.   These considerations strongly argue for <b>the need that there be no crosstalk of any kind allowed in ACA meetings</b>, where crosstalk is defined in this context as: making any sort of comment, judgment or criticism about another's sharing.  This also includes that the leader refrain from making comments between the sharing of other members, and that the leader not specifically choose people to share, or the sequence of sharing, but rather, simply share first and then open the meeting, allowing those who want to participate to initiate their own request to do so.  This most importantly, ensures that no one member is acting out of their need to be in control, and it reinforces Tradition Two, which states that: "For our group purpose, there is no authority except a loving God, as He may express himself in she group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants they do not govern." This is consistent with the basic equality of all members present.  All of this is standard format in ACA meetings, and there exist standard handouts that explain these boundaries, which are read at the beginning of every meeting.   </p>


<p>     In the last several years, however, I observed a self-promoting New Age therapist, with a drug and alcohol counseling degree, set himself up as the only leader of a weekly ACA Step Study meeting.  Although this person had only been in the program several years, he subtly set himself up to be in control and believes himself to be an expert in this kind of recovery---the healing of childhood trauma.  <b>This essay will show how, <i>by God's grace alone</i>, I came to intuitively understand that, not only is he not an expert---quite the opposite---he is actually an <i>unhealed healer</i>, that is essentially teaching ACA's not to talk about and feel their repressed childhood feelings---the very thing they need the most support in doing in order to heal!</b>  This person is, in fact, not the asset that he believes himself to be within the recovery community.  It is particularly unfortunate, since this meeting in question is small and attended almost exclusively by newcomers to the world of recovery in general, and who therefore have no frame of reference for how a healthy, effective  ACA support group is operated.  They have no reason to believe that they are being misled, and therefore no reason to even go to another meeting for comparison.  Being brand new to ACA, they are also very impressionable and potentially even easily indoctrinated.  ACA's also tend to be "frightened of authority figures, and any personal criticism" and to "feel guilty when they stand up for themselves." All this makes it highly unlikely if not impossible, that they will initiate or follow, any attempt to dethrone the exclusive leadership of someone advertising themselves as a therapist.  I have personally observed veterans of ACA that visited this meeting, approach this man and ask if they can sign up to participate in chairing or leading the meeting for a month. He has responded negatively and told them that the meeting is just something that he does for his own recovery.  The translation here is: "I am in control here, this is my meeting, and if you don't like it, you can go somewhere else."  Rather than truly serving anyone else, individuals that basically abuse the 12-step process in this manner---and there is no lack of them---attempt to meet their own fear-based, self-centered, ungratified needs and do not really care about how it affects others in recovery or the group  a whole.  Although they often think that they are acting in everyone's best interests, their true, even if, unconscious perception of others is, as being little more than two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, that they can manipulate within the world of their own, as yet, fragile ego.   </p>

<p>     I finally saw a strange incongruency in this person's behavior. He began announcing a new Al-Anon meeting to the Adult Children of Alcoholic group that he led.  He did this several weeks in a row.  Twice I asked him whether it was a standard Al-Anon meeting or a meeting specifically for Adult Children from Alcoholic families.  Both times, he replied that it was for Adult Children of Alcoholics.  I then attended the new meeting and learned that it was a standard Al-Anon meeting that allowed anyone that had been affected by someone else's drinking, rather than a meeting limited to those with alcoholic parents. He also turned out to be the leader of the meeting, and therefore knew perfectly well that it was a regular Al-Anon group.  However, the following night he again announced it as a new 'ACA' meeting.  When I later attempted to clarify this with him, he said "Oh, they're all the same." I didn't think much more about this inconsistency until after the following event. 

<p>     About a week later, he engaged in some very unsafe behavior while leading the ACA meeting.  He opened the meeting by talking for about fifteen minutes.  I then began to share about the emergence in my therapy session that morning of some very deep unconscious messages, that I had originally given myself in my traumatic childhood, which I only now consciously discovered had completely ruled my life.  While I was sharing these intimate details and therefore in a very vulnerable position, I noticed some activity in my peripheral vision.  I went on speaking for about thirty seconds before looking up to see that he was most inappropriately making very large circular movements around his wristwatch in front of everyone.  I looked at the clock and saw that I had been speaking for just over four minutes.  (And this guy is supposed to be a therapist!).  I did not think much about this for two days, at which time I began to get angry.  Within the next several days, I found myself pondering our previous conversations and interactions over the past several years and particularly his recent incongruency concerning the mixing up of the two different versions of Al-Anon meetings.  I then finally saw the cause of his incongruency.  This mental connection within me was also accompanied by several intuitive 'hits' in my chest!  What I clearly saw was that he had not done his anger work with his father. In fact, he had developed a philosophy around releasing his parents from any responsibility in properly parenting him as a child, because they were simply incapable of giving him what he needed.  In other words, he had put the responsibly and/or blame for his abuse, squarely on the needy innocent child that he had been, rather than face the horrible truth of the childhood and life potential that his parents had robbed him of, by not adequately raising him!  He was flat-out wrong in treating his child like an adult.  It was then that I realized that he was confusing the two recovery programs of Al-Anon and Adult Children of Alcoholics.  This was obvious from the fact that he was applying an <i>adult</i> Al-Anon solution to his <i>childhood</i> dis-ease.  In other words, his recovery was thwarted from applying the wrong remedy to his problem --- a solution that could not possibly be effective --- since it erroneously made a child responsible for the failure of the parent.  In truth, the child has already erroneously blamed itself in childhood, and likely stored these self-accusing messages into its unconscious, since the child's belief in their own weakness and badness is simply too much for him to consciously bear.  The confusing of the two types of meetings, then represented a type of 'Freudian slip' on his part, since he has failed to see how he has unconsciously mixed the different recovery protocols of the Al-Anon and Adult Children of Alcoholic programs.</p> 

<p>    I can even feel compassion for this person, since the only thing left for him to do under these circumstances is to seek to be 'the expert in control.'  Only in this way can he continue to maintain the facade that he has true recovery. </p>



<p>before he had truly gone into himself and felt the tremendous pain of what had happened to him.  As a therapist he gets to remain 'the expert in control' and therefore he does not have to get on the same 'human' level with others in recovery and thereby risk becoming truly vulnerable.
