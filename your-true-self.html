    <h2>"You Have Found Your True Self!"</h2> 

    <p>While in the scientific workplace in the mid-nineties, I was the recipient of some attempted sabotage by a co-worker that was not happy with the job that I was doing. The truth of the situation was that my job performance left something to be desired. At this time in recovery, I found myself in a rapid period of personality change.
